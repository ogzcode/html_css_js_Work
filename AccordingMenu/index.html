						CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. 
						It is the language for describing the presentation of Web pages, 
						including colours, layout, and fonts, thus making our web 
						pages presentable to the users. 
						CSS is designed to make style sheets for the web.

						JavaScript is a scripting or programming language that allows you to 
						implement complex features on web pages — 
						every time a web page does more than just sit there and display 
						static information for you to look at — displaying timely content 
						updates, interactive maps, animated 2D/3D graphics, scrolling video jukeboxes, 
						etc. — you can bet that JavaScript is probably involved.
